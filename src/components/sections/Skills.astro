      During my education, I have gained proficiency in various digital tools
      and programs. Within graphic design, social content, and web design, I
      have worked with software such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and
      InDesign to create visual and creative solutions. I have also developed
      skills in social content creation, where I have produced material for
      digital communication. Additionally, I have experience in web development
      and design, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as working with
      frameworks and tools like Astro, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
